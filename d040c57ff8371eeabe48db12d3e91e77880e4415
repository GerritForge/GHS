      "message": "I should probably have specified, this is code generated from `sbt new` - I only changed the `organization{,Name}`.\n\nIn the commit I\u0027m working on I\u0027m changing this slightly to be have a `testDependencies` lazy val which adds `Test` to all the test dependencies. That way the Dependencies only specifies libraries/version, but the scope is set in the sbt file.\n\nI\u0027m not necessarily saying it\u0027s better, but maybe let\u0027s keep it like that for now as it\u0027s early days, and we can decide whether to change it once it\u0027s grown a little (I don\u0027t think we\u0027d be painting ourselves in a corner).\n\nWDYT?",
